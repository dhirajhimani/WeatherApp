# WeatherApp

We would suggest that you build a native app with Java.
We prefer that you use MVP or even MVVM.
It would also be great if you could use Android data binding APIs


The Problem

You need to build out a small application to fetch the weather forecast of multiple cities

Step 1 : Get an API Key

Head over to OpenWeatherMap and register for an account
Once you are in, go to your personal page and get the API key
Step 2

The app should accept multiple city names from the user
Based on the city names entered, the app should show the the weather forecast for the 14 days for each city
Step 3

Find the current city using GPS
Display the weather forecast for the current city for 14 days
